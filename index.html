    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Hi, I'm Parixit </p>
 <p>I'm a B.Tech(CSE) student at <strong>South Asian University, New Delhi</strong>, and I've been deeply immersed in the world of programming for the past few months. I started my journey with C and Python, and currently exploring web technologies.</p>

<p>I enjoy breaking things down, experimenting, and learning by building, whether that means writing code, fixing bugs that took way too long to find, or exploring how software and systems work under the hood. <strong>I spend a good part of my day learning something new</strong>, usually related to programming, computers, or technology in general. I like the feeling of making progress, even if it's slow and messy sometimes.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I love playing badminton, it keeps me active and clears my head. I'm also a big fan of long walks, especially when I need time to think or reset. Music is always with me, it's my background companion while coding, walking, or just zoning out and reflecting.</p>

<p>I enjoy quiet focus, late-night learning sessions, and the satisfaction of finally understanding something that didn't make sense before. I'm constantly exploring, and always looking to grow—both as a developer and as a person. This website is a small space where I document my journey, experiments, and ideas as I keep learning and building.
